## Paragraph 1
The NBA Draft is a highly anticipated event that showcases the future stars of professional basketball. It usually takes place in late June, after the conclusion of the NBA playoffs. In the draft, teams have the opportunity to select players who have declared their eligibility and meet certain criteria, such as being at least 19 years old and being one year removed from high school. The draft order is determined through a combination of a lottery system and team records from the previous season, with the teams with the worst records receiving higher picks.

## Paragraph 2
The NBA Draft has a significant impact on the league's landscape as teams aim to secure talented players who can make an immediate impact or develop into key contributors over time. The draft process involves extensive scouting, player evaluations, and pre-draft workouts, with teams investing significant resources to make informed decisions.

### Subsection 1
Additionally, draft picks hold trade many value, and teams often engage in trades to move up or down in the draft order or acquire established players by using their draft assets as bargaining chips.
